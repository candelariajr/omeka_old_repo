Playwright and novelist Romulus Linney was born on September 21, 1930, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The only child of Dr. Romulus "Zach" Linney III and his wife Maitland (nee Thompson), Linney was the great-grandson of North Carolina Congressman Romulus Zachariah Linney I. Linney spent much of his childhood in Boone, North Carolina, and Madison, Tennessee, but moved with his mother to Washington, D.C. after the death of his father in 1943. Linney graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1949 and attended Oberlin College. During his time as a student in Oberlin, Linney acted in a number of productions staged by the Oberlin Dramatic Association under the direction of J. Stanton McLaughlin.</p><p>

After graduating with his Bachelor's of Arts in 1953, Linney began a Master's program at Yale University's School of Drama majoring in acting but left in 1954 after being drafted into the Army. He was primarily stationed at Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. While on leave in Japan, Linney observed Japanese Kabuki theater and became interested in Noh theater. Linney was honorably discharged after two years and returned to Yale to complete a Master's of Fine Arts degree with a major in directing in 1958. He used Japanese influences in the staging of Eugene O'Neill's play, "Marco Millions," his thesis production. While in college and graduate school, Linney performed as an actor in summer stock including the Williamstown Theatre Festival, the New London Barn Playhouse in New London, NH, and the Pelican Players in Panama City, FL.

Following Yale, Linney went to New York City where he worked as a stage manager for Elia Kazan at the Actors' Studio and studied writing with Hiram Hayden, founder of Atheneum Press, at The New School. Hayden optioned the novel Linney was writing in class, and "Heathen Valley" was published in 1962. A second novel, "Slowly, By Thy Hand Unfurled," was published in 1965. A set of short stories, "Jesus Tales," was published in 1980. Over his lifetime, in addition to these three novels, Linney authored four opera librettos, twenty short stories, and 85 plays which have been staged throughout the United States, in Europe and Asia.
